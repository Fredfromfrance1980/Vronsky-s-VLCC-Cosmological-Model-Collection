# Vronsky-s-VLCC-Cosmological-Model-Collection
A speculative cosmological framework without dark matter, based on frozen light, gliding structures, and an active time field. Includes mathematical validation and falsifiability tools. English version of the full VLCC model by FrÃ©dÃ©rick Vronsky.
# ðŸŒŒ VLCC â€” A Speculative Cosmological Model of Photonically Differentiated Space-Time

This repository contains the full English version of the **VLCC model** (*Vectors of Light with Curved Cosmology*) developed by **FrÃ©dÃ©rick Vronsky**.

The VLCC proposes a cosmology without dark matter, based on frozen light zones (Freeze Spheres), differential photonic tensions, and an active temporal field behaving like matter. It envisions the universe as a relational, elastic, and morphogenic structure, shaped by gliding photonic configurations.
